Setup
-----

    Requirements:

    python - version 3.4.2 was used during development. It should work with 2.7 too.

    python packages:

      theano (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)

      keras - at time of writing, the version on pip is not current and will
      cause model saving to fail. Use the version from github instead
      (https://github.com/fchollet/keras). Run the IntegrationTest unit test to
      verify that you have a proper version of keras.

      datrie - pip install datrie

      scikit-learn - pip install scikit-learn

Tests
-----

Run automated tests by:

    python pwd_guess_unit.py

or to run only specific tests:

    python -m unittest pwd_guess_unit.<specific unit test>


Most tests are very quick, however each EndToEnd test may take 10-15 minutes.


Help
----

Use:

python pwd_guess.py --help

for general command line help. Use:

python pwd_guess.py --help-config

for help about variables in configuration files.


Version
-------

Use:

python pwd_guess.py --version

to find the version.
